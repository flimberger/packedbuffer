benchmark
---------

test machine: 6 cores Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz

mem: 67108864 * 20 = 1342177280 (1.25 GB)

first take:
128 rounds with 67108864 items each: 445.28125 ms

reduced allocations:
128 rounds with 67108864 items each: 623.6953125 ms

reference:
128 rounds with 67108864 items each: 152.9296875 ms
During execution,
Java regularly fires up all 12 cores.
While the actual processing time is way shorter than for the other benchmarks,
it took way longer for data creation,
and it wouldn't even run without extra code for triggering the GC (and waiting for it).
Unfortunately,
all those other metrics (CPU utilization, time spent managing memory) don't show up in this simplistic benchmark.
